## 🔬 Technical Highlights

### 1. Real Machine Learning
- **Not a lookup table**: Genuine neural network training
- **Not hardcoded**: Power values predicted from learned patterns
- **Not fake variation**: Real backpropagation with 1,505 parameters

### 2. Realistic State Machine
- **Probabilistic transitions**: Not fixed 90-second intervals
- **Variable durations**: 30 seconds to 15 minutes
- **IoT-based probabilities**: Realistic device behavior patterns

### 3. Environmental Intelligence
```cpp
Power = Base × Temperature_Factor × Battery_Factor × CPU_Factor + Noise

Temperature: ±0.8% per °C from 25°C
Battery:     5-10% variation based on charge level
CPU:         Up to 5% increase under load
Noise:       State-specific (1.5%-3.0%)
```

## 🧪 Verification

### Quick Validation Commands

```bash
# 1. Check compilation
make clean && make
# Expected: Clean build with no errors

# 2. Verify training
./testbench_dvconchallenge 2>&1 | grep "Epoch"
# Expected: Training loss decreasing over epochs

# 3. Check power variation
awk -F';' 'NR>1 {gsub(/,/, ".", $4); print $4}' seai_competition_results.csv | sort -n | uniq | head -10
# Expected: Multiple different power values (not all the same)

# 4. Verify state transitions
cut -d';' -f1,5 seai_competition_results.csv | head -20
